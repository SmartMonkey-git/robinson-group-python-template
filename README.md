### Continuous Distribution
You've done it, your package is at a state, where you want other to use it. Luckily, this repository features a CD-Pipeline,
that will build and upload your packages to Pypi for you. To get the CD running you need to first follow these [instructions](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/). The pipeline uses [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) to authenticate on Pypi. Make sure your [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) is set up correctly.

Then open your repository page on Github. To the right you should find **Create new Release**. Press it!
