    An example usage can be shown with a doctest:

    >>> from project_name.foo import foo
    >>> foo()
    True

    Doctests are included in the test suite and checked in the CI.
    
    Doctests can help users understand the code and adding a few examples may not be too hard.
    However, it still takes time which is often a limiting resource.
    Therefore, please use your judgment before documenting each and every function.
